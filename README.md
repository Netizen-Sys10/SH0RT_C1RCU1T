# My Awesome Project

After some relatively straightforward javascript projects, we wanted to tackle something more complex that would require a deeper understanding of the language. We opted to include the jQuery library for its more intuitive library of terms, as the project relies a great deal on HTML DOM manipulataion.

## How It's Made:


## Limitations

Although this page is responsive and can be scaled down for mobile devices, the card images for the desktop version have all be kept at their original size. The images used are Susan Kare's designs for the original Microsoft Solitaire, chosen to contrast the cyberpunk theme of the game with recognizable, retro visuals. On screens larger than 1200px, the game board's dimensions are maintained for visual cohension and responsiveness largely affects the green background framing the game board. 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Observer pattern saved us helper functions? (Really saved me from giant incomprehensible functions but they don't need to know that lol)

## Lessons Learned:

observer pattern as cleaner way to run multiple reliant functions ?
As (my? Our?) first collaborative github project, this was excellent practice on how to better structure code for another person to easily read and interact with.
Using git bash
Carefully sequencing multiple events?
The system for connecting html elements to their related javascript objects and modifying both in tandem
